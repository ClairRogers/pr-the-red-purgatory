                <p>The last thing you remember about being alive is the splitting pain in your head. You had wanted nothing more than for the pain to go away, for your head to stop burning like this. </P>
                  <p>And then it stopped. It was so sudden and abrupt your eyes had flown open in panic. But the mountain was gone, and you were standing in nothing. Blackness stretched onwards, except for the cat standing directly in front of you. Except this wasn’t a cat. It was red--as red as the strings you’d grown used to seeing. It was shaped exactly like you but it had no features, no pelt or markings or face. It was just red. It stared at you with burning white eyes and you could hear that familiar humming noise, the one that you always heard when you got too close to the strings. It looked unstable, the edges of its form jumping and twisting randomly. Particles of red light shed here and there from its body.</p>
                  <p>It steps past you. You aren’t afraid of it, you realize. Just shocked. You turn to follow its walk, and for the first time you notice it in the darkness: yourself. Your body. Laying on the ground behind you, dead and gone. Lifeless and cold. Now, you are afraid. The red thing steps up to the body and you cannot move, cannot cry out. There is a moment when the red turns to look at you one more time, and there is a flash. </P>
                  <hr>
                  <p>And then you are somewhere. Now, you are standing somewhere. Twilight peeks over the horizon. Stars twinkle overhead--millions of them. More than you have ever seen, but farther away than you ever remember the sky feeling. The hard-packed sediment under your paws is dry and dusty. There is a massive twisted tree in the distance; that is all there is. The tree is bigger than anything you had ever seen, the branches stretching outwards until they vanished into the sky.</p>
                  <p>You are not alone. All of your trialmates stand among you just as you’d always remembered them. Their eyes are no longer red with the sickness. You look around at each other, getting your bearings.</p> 
                  <p>A stranger sits in front of you. She doesn’t seem surprised to see you here, and the cats you’d seen get the Plague first seem to have been speaking with her. She turns to everyone.</p>
                  <img src="./aberdeen.png" alt="" width="98%">
                  <p><b>”The rest are here, now,”</b> she says. <b>”Welcome, everyone. My name is Aberdeen. You have all died of the Red Plague, and this is where all who get sick come.”</b> She pauses, thinking and observing you all. <b>”I don’t think anyone else will join us, now. Helena has your power, and I don’t think she needs any more to complete her world.”</b> </p>
                  <p><b>”I’ll try to answer your questions as best as I can,”</b> Aberdeen continues. <b>”But...please understand that I am just another soul here. I was the first to arrive, and I wandered this place alone for some time before I saw anyone else come. I found purpose in welcoming the dead to this purgatory, and that’s the only reason I’ve held onto myself all this time. I had...I had hope, I think, that you, the fledgelings, would put an end to the death. You’d stop the Plague. But...I see now that’s all it ever was. Hope.”</b> She sighs, shaking her head. <b>”Don’t take this as blame on you. It’s okay. It’s as Helena has said from the start-- our world was always doomed to die.”</b></p>
                  <p><b>”Please, come to me with any questions you have,”</b> she says. <b>”I will try my best. But...I think once I have answered your questions, I will go away. The mists...they’re calling to me. They’ll call to you one day, too, I’m sure. I think I would like to rest.”</b></p>
                  <p>Aberdeen falls quiet then, and the silence hangs here in this space between life and death. And in the quiet, it hits you. It <i>really</i> finally hits you.</p> 
                  <p>This was game over, and you had lost.</p>

                  <p>Welcome to the interim, The Red Purgatory! As always, interims are meant to be used as rest periods in the story, for you to relax without any participation requirements. Feel free to take a break, roleplay, level up, or more.</p> 
                  <p>The current length of the interim is unknown but, as always, Calstan will announce a date when we know one!</p>
                  <h3>Trial 004 Player Casualties</h3>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Souta</li>
                    <li>Kazuma</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Location Details</h3>
                  <p>A confusing wasteland. The sky overhead is bright with stars that seem too far away, too distant. A forever twilight hangs on the horizon. The ground under your paws is dry, flaking and crumbling like dust. There is no prey here, but you do not feel hungry.</p>
                  <p>In some areas, a heavy fog drifts through the landscape, obscuring your vision. It seems like you can travel, but your paws always carry you back to the main clearing no matter what you do. You catch glimpses of other cats in the distance, but they are always too far away to hear you, and no matter how much you chase them, you never reach them. Some of these cats you recognize. Lost souls of the Plagued. </p>
                  <p>The mists reach out to you. It is not malicious or even particularly friendly; it feels like it is offering you something. An escape, perhaps. You get the feeling if you welcome it, you will forget everything else. Succumb to the unknown and release yourself from the complicated intricacies of life. Spending too long in the mists will cloud your mind, confuse you about who you are, and who you <i>were.</i> You don’t want to do that. You don’t want to be lost here.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Effects of the Red Purgatory</h3> 
                  <p>You don’t feel the breeze on your pelt or the pang of hunger or thirst here. You can feel pain; all of your injuries you sustained on the mountain are still very present. You can feel the warmth of another’s embrace-- the physical touch of another lost soul. This is what keeps you grounded, keeps your head clear and your eyes bright. </p>
                  <p>Your powers still work. Using your abilities also helps to keep your mind from drifting too far, from letting yourself be called into the endless abyss of mist. Your powers keep you anchored to what you had before. To the life you had before everything went wrong. </p>
                  <p>You do sleep, but it doesn’t happen quite like you remember it. You never remember sleeping, and you never remember waking up. But sometime in between those moments, you dream of memories. Your own memories, the happy and the sad and the calm and the horrifying. They are all so vivid, but they are also tinted with the color of your soul. It’s like your power is trying to remind you who you are.</p>
                  <p>All cats who get the Plague end up here. But all that have come before you, save for Aberdeen, have been lost in the mist. You are unable to reach them. Aberdeen tells you that sometimes a cat’s soul will leave this place, but only if their body on the other side dies a final death. If they don’t, they wander this place forever.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Thank you to ALL of our guests and Legendaries who made Trial 04 so unique! We hope the experience was as fun for you as it was for us!</li><li>Guest characters have all escaped the mountain thanks to help of Snowberry, the serpent. She has given you a task: spread the word of the end of the world and save as many lives as you can. The Plagued fledgelings are coming after you.</li><li>Guests are free to roleplay these interactions in the spectator server or in Google Docs. All characters who tried out but were <i>not</i> selected for Trial 04 participation are also welcome to join in!<li>Characters who were not participants in Trial 04 can safely assume that during the finale battle, they were able to escape from the mountain tunnels as well.</li></li><li>While Snowberry helped you all escape the mountain, she disappeared soon after (this is mostly so we are not being held obligated to write checkpoints for her during our breaktime!).</li><li>Legendaries have all been captured and trapped in the strings at the top of Highpeak! You will likely remain here for the entirety of the interim.</li>

            <h3>Fledgelings and Aberdeen</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Aberdeen is your current interim guide. She is the first cat to be Plagued, and will be present for a while after you all arrive at the Red Purgatory.</li><li>While your characters may ask her questions about the interim location, we will not be writing checkpoints for this. Please send all of your interim questions to the #help-center chat in the Paradise Rising server, and we will answer them there!</li>

            <h3>Hints, Alignments, and more</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>We have more hints to go through! Keep your eyes peeled for hidden soul partner hints throughout the interim. We will alert everyone when we no longer have any hints to post.</li><li>Everyone now has four alignment requests. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSco3cTLFVyGXLYzcMEqCZJLE0m0NUO4GiYl6Bibg5Yw1aDMvA/viewform?usp=sf_link">Send those in</a> if you want them to help you find your soul partner!</li><li>Keep an eye out for updates regarding this...there will be more to come throughout the interim.</li>

            There’s nothing here; the ground under your paws is a sedimentary rock that flakes under your claws. It’s a large area, large enough that every single fledgeling can stay here comfortably if they wanted. In the center of the hollow, there is a giant, twisted tree. No leaves decorate its branches, and you’re sure it’s dead. It towers over your heads and reaches out over the landing like a rooftop, shielding you from the nothingness above. 
            <h4 class="top-spacing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XQQ6yBmt8G-J7mcOEeZi88y9m9l3c4qfwol-0At4oAU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">The Tree</a></h4> 
            In the center of The Hollow is the only major landmark for miles: the tree. Its twisted trunk reaches high into the sky, so tall that you have to tilt your head all the way back to see the top. The branches are dead and leafless, and no wind rattles through them. They reach out wide above you, covering most of the Hollow under their protection. The branches are sturdy enough that cats could climb into the tree, and there are plenty of nooks in branches where one could curl up and sleep, or sit to watch the stars above.
            <h4 class="top-spacing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17n9aBtTqE2txubOzpq78yg-6chOyz2W97WuL687Yrvs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">The Boat</a></h4> 
            Something sits on the horizon you can’t identify. However, as you get closer you see what it is: the remains of a large human-era boat, resting on the flats. It has mostly rusted away at this point--just the shell and some jagged pieces of pockmarked metal remain. It offers up nothing interesting or helpful beyond its existence and the pocket of shelter the crumbling interior still provides.
            <h4 class="top-spacing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9oiU859kU0o_be-9uCbW7fwrIqhUqDNhJRsWT87dkQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">The Dune</a></h4> 
            Out past the pool and beyond the Hollow, the wind has pulled much sediment and salt across the land to form a single sandy dune that rises out of the landscape. Two stories high at its tallest, it is a good climb for anyone who wants a view of the nothingness surrounding them. From up here, you can see a wide gash of stars reach from horizon to horizon, and sometimes in the right light, you can catch the sparkle of salty sand as it’s blown from the dune’s peak.
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 center">
            <h4><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LniHqiy2dNgmgESIvyAvRLHORk3r5sBP2doNGydpQs8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">The Pool</a></h4> 
            If you wander through the mists, one of the first places you stumble upon is a perfectly circular pool of dark water. The smooth stone ground falls away into a shallow dip. The water is clean, you think, but also pitch black. When you try to drink it, there is a distinct lack of taste; you can’t feel the coolness on your tongue and the pool never seems to deplete. If you disturb the surface, sometimes you can catch glimpses of images in the ripples. Here, you can look through your own body’s eyes. You can see through your Plagued eyes, see where Helena and Kaulu are puppeting your claws. 
            <h4 class="top-spacing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iLphKpwI2jm0blwuK4sBvCC688j9EpTE17mSPb31xVw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">The Salt Flats</a></h4> 
            Extending in all directions beyond the Hollow are the salt flats. The ground crumbles easily beneath your paws, and smells of salt. It's as if there used to be a thin layer of water here, but it has all dried up, leaving only ridges of salt and sediment behind. By and large, there is nothing here--just a wide, flat expanse. But no matter how far you walk in a single direction, if you turn around you will always see the tree at the center of the Hollow. 
            <h4 class="top-spacing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1siC_5dYe990guHBtZr0JV0P83jE_eFp2ye7QhS53OsY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">The Sailing Stones</a></h4> 
            Near the Hollow is a curious sight: a handful of great big boulders resting on the otherwise flat landscape. When you approach, you see that the stones are way too big for a creature to move. However, despite this, you can see drag marks on the dry, cracked ground behind the stones, indicating they came from… somewhere. When you leave and return, the rocks have always shifted positions. How did they move? Who--or what--moved them?
