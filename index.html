                <p>The darkness that followed the wave was not unwelcome. It was heavy, numbing, so dark that, while you’re stuck in it, you almost completely forget about everything that is going on around you. You forget your power, the games, the death. Yourself. </p>
                <p>But it doesn’t last. The moment you are suddenly aware that you feel like you’re <i>drowning</i>, is the moment that you begin to kick and thrash, and in the next moment the water pulls away, leaving you coughing and heaving on a cool, smooth surface. </p>
                <p>When you finally look up, you’re in a different world.</p> 
                <p>You’re laying amongst your teammates on a beautiful terrace; high pillars of marble soar over your head, vibrant green vines wrapping around them, holding an arching ceiling over your head with hundreds of colors painted into a beautiful, ornate mural. Warm sunlight hits your pelt from the open sides, and to the south there is a staircase that leads off into a huge, sprawling lake. Under the water you can see more marble buildings, most almost completely broken, but some are nearly entirely intact. The water is crystal clear, all the way to the bottom, and you can see schools of fish swimming lazily through the ruins. Snow-capped mountains cut into the brilliant blue sky in the distance.</p> 
                <p>It would all be so peaceful and calm if it weren’t for the teammates who don’t stand up. The reminders of what you had just seen. The exhaustion hangs on your bones. You feel so, so tired.</p> 
                <p>Syaoran and Kismet lay dead on the smooth marble. And when you look again, two more cats don’t get back up; Osmani and Ivah are stiff, their bodies already growing cold. Someone tries to revive them, desperately, but it’s too late. They had drowned in the tidal wave. </p>
                <p><b> “Well,"</b> you hear a voice rise above the rest. You look up, and perched above you on a high ledge is Oordeel; it feels strange to see him with his wings, with his tail vanishing into a plume of smoke, his eyes a bit too vibrant, his neck adorned in the high collar. He’s staring at the two drowned cats. <b> “Guess I didn’t pull us here fast enough. That was an unfortunate development, Helena getting her power back. Should have seen it coming."</b> He looks back up at you, his expression serious and cold. <b> “It just means things are about to start moving much more quickly. Now that Helena has her wings back, her next move will be on the Legendaries; she will want to get them out of her way." </p>
                <p>“We need to save them."</b> </p>
                <p>He stands, stretching his wings, and you think that he’s actually grown since getting his power back. <b> “You can’t take on Helena on your own; and neither can I, not with Kaulu giving her the power she needs. You’re too inexperienced, and I don’t know what Helena’s plans are. I’m going to go figure it out. I don’t know how long I’ll be gone. But while I’m figuring out what our next move will be, you will be safe here. I created this place out of Helena’s sight; you’re hidden. She won’t come looking for you. Hide, stay here, and <i>practice your damn powers.</i> I assume some of you have discovered that you can align, yes? Figure that out."</b> </p>
                <p>He stretches his wings and turns to take off, but then glances at you one more time. <b> “Be ready when I return. A war has begun. And if you’re not prepared, you will <i>all</i> die."</b> </p>
                <p>With a rush of wind, Oordeel’s wings push him into the sky, and he’s gone. </p>

                  <p>Welcome to the interim, The Sunken Gardens! As always, interims are meant to be used as rest periods in the story, for you to relax without any participation requirements. Feel free to take a break, roleplay, level up, or more. There are a couple things to note about this interim.</p> 
                  <ul><li>Oordeel has given you a task! Prepare, train, practice your powers. Your character can take this request however they please.</li><li> <b>Leftover gold coins can be converted to stat points!</b> If you have any leftover gold coins from Trial 3, you can use them to add stat points to your character’s app. One coin = one stat point. There is a maximum of +3 stats, though (if your character has 4 coins, only 3 can be converted). Extra coins <b>can</b> be given to other players. </li><li>During this interim, you will be allowed to periodically ask for alignment confirmations! Please see the rules section for more details.</li><li>If you have an idea for a new public roleplay location, let us know! If you can, find an image or gif we can use as a header, too, as well as write a short description.</li><li>Read the Trial 3 recap <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi-NhFN3D8wRCyz0BUcWwYjTUj9VyD5Eh2dm2hLjEr8/edit?usp=sharing">HERE</a></li></ul>
                  <p>The current length of the interim is unknown, but Calstan will announce a date when we know one! For now just relax and don't fret over the Trial 4 start date. Thank you!</p>

            <h3>Alignment Information</h3>
            <ul><li>During Trial 3, some characters may have begun to accidentally align!

However, you now have the opportunity to confirm <b>one alignment degree</b> with your character!</li><li>You will submit your request on a Google form, and Calstan will send you the results via Discord DM. You are not to share this degree with <b>anybody</b> in the group, except with the person who you got the confirmed degree with (ie: if Everett requested to know his alignment degree with Judas, Stan can share the result with Skye, but not with anyone else.)</li><li>Please keep your confirmed alignment a secret until told otherwise; spreading this information could potentially jeopardize the game for others, and if it continues could be grounds for your removal from the group.</li><li>If you plan on aligning powers with a character you do not know the degree of, it should be treated as a fourth degree alignment!</li> <li><a href="https://forms.gle/Qiefqv2hbQwQenir7">Request your alignment degree confirmation here!!</a></li></ul>

            The terrace is a beautiful ancient human structure, sculpted from marble and worn with what looks like years of age. Tall pillars soar up, some holding up bits of roof, others holding nothing. Cracks in the floor reveal small rivets of crystal clear water, all leading out into a vast lake. On the far distant side of the lake are beautiful snow-capped mountains. 
            <h4 class="top-spacing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mw4c0d3rFjZD8bG43JqEVI4KgMzB9ZZwOxqHraK2IGQ/edit?usp=sharing">The Greenhouse</a></h4> 
            Just off the main terrace is a glass building filled to the ceiling with flourishing plants of all kinds; tall ferns, twisting vines, sweet flowers, countless herbs. The air here is humid and heavy, and every now and then there is a mist of water that floats down from small pipes that line the ceiling. 
            <h4 class="top-spacing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qYkDGt4BbZSwTFO_xULn-kdyYWJ4GvoPBaE2BRHnNGs/edit?usp=sharing">The Star Room</a></h4> 
            A twisting staircase leads you up into a tower behind the greenhouse. At the top is an ornate room with charts of the stars inlaid into the walls. The ceiling is open to the sky, and at night the stars are as clear as day. Some dusty old textbooks are scattered across the floor, all relating to space or the sky, from black holes to weather patterns. 
            <h4 class="top-spacing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d9R6JI18dx_6BhhvSp-0tacyARQhzAnXWOdgCTR9FjU/edit?usp=sharing">The Misty Garden</a></h4> 
            On the outskirts of the Sunken Gardens is a small open field of orderly-planted flowers. In the morning a small mist rolls over the field, making the field quiet and serene. 
            <h4 class="top-spacing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pxcFQi24LyCVRc5qGUZ9U_nMC6CJ5PzTY_rEnkyUGW8/edit?usp=sharing">The Lily Pond</a></h4> 
            Nestled between the misty garden and the hedge maze, the lily pond is quiet and peaceful, though for some reason it seems to rain here more often than the rest of the gardens.
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 center">
            <h4><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/130GCOZkEAkVhF6WAu_Nk33yJnAGIUUaiq_o1kGqw_fY/edit?usp=sharing">The Hedge Maze</a></h4> 
            Tall hedge bushes create a maze through the edges of the Sunken Garden. It is not difficult to navigate, but it seems oddly easy to get caught up in the quiet, wandering through the hedge with no clear purpose. 
            <h4 class="top-spacing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QUqrwl1Se2FeEOqLuxCmZF9zRREW8Ak2-PLNq1eJifw/edit?usp=sharing">The Ruins</a></h4> 
            This seems to be the most suitable place to practice combat. Piles of old marble ruins lay scattered across a grass courtyard, nestled between the ornate marble statues of humans. Trees arching overhead offer plenty of shade. 
            <h4 class="top-spacing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zLSv1YFBdBFEfvVP6b4HKLiDylLHD4bzqXdTcFTM6e8/edit?usp=sharing">The Crypt</a></h4> 
            It took a while for anyone to stumble across the crypt hidden underneath the gardens. It looks more like a cave than a built structure, overgrown and worn down with time. Dusty old artifacts line the walls, but there doesn’t seem to be much more down here than that. 
            <h4 class="top-spacing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Z0_6xxUDpDlNgWGwrU8t_uyIAVvagXQhc6kHByd9H0/edit?usp=sharing">The Courtyard</a></h4> 
            Surrounded on all sides by walls of vines is a calm, quiet courtyard. In the center is a statue with water pouring out of the top steadily, flowing down over the marble into a pool. This looks like the best place for sparring matches or large gatherings.
